# RoboBehaviors-and-Finite-State-Machines-Project
Your goal in this project will be to program the Neato to execute a number of behaviors (e.g., teleop, driving a trajectory of a pre-defined shape, wall-following, people-following, and obstacle avoidance) within a finite-state machine.


    For each behavior, describe the problem at a high-level. Include any relevant diagrams that help explain your approach.  Discuss your strategy at a high-level and include any design decisions that had to be made to realize a successful implementation.
    For the finite state controller, what was the overall behavior? What were the states? What did the robot do in each state? How did you combine behaviors together and how did you detect when to transition between behaviors?  Consider including a state transition diagram in your writeup.
    How was your code structured? Make sure to include a sufficient detail about the object-oriented structure you used for your project.
    What, if any, challenges did you face along the way?
    What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?
    What are the key takeaways from this assignment for future robotic programming projects? For each takeaway, provide a sentence or two of elaboration.
